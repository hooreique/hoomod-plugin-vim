# Hoomod

Hoomod is a unique modification for Vim that significantly alters nearly all of its default behaviors. Unlike traditional Vim which is based on the QWERTY layout, Hoomod is designed around the Colemak layout.

With Hoomod, Vim becomes more intuitive to use. It prioritizes finger placement over the conventional word-oriented key assignments.

Consider Hoomod a streamlined version of Vim. It simplifies the experience by removing many default commands, making it less suitable for power users of Vim.
